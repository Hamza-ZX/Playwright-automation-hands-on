# Playwright-Automation-Hands-On

In this repository, I’ll be sharing automation scripts built with **[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)**.  
The goal is to provide hands-on examples that cover different aspects of automation testing, including:  

- ✅ **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**  
- ♿ **Accessibility Testing**  
- 🧩 **Component Testing**  
- 🌐 **API Testing**  

For practice and demonstration purposes, we’ll be using the **OrangeHRM demo application**:
